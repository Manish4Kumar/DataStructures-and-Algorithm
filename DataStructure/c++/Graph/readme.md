# Types Of Graphs:- 
# 1. Undirected Graphs      2. Directed Graphs
# Undirected Graphs: ->The edges are undirected.

# Directed Graphs: -> The edges are directed.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Degrees:-
# 1. Degree in Undirected Graph:- Degeree of a node is the total number edges connected to it.
# for eg:- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83713146/134466881-e4e9e597-694e-49ad-9e6b-435cd4a56c59.png)
# Degeree of node(2) is 3.
# Note: there is nothing like indegree or outdegree in the case of undirected graph.
# 2. Degree in Directed graphs:- There are two types in it.
# 1. Indegree 
# 2. Outdegree
# Incoming :- The edges which are coming towards the node.
# Outgoing :- The edges which are going away from the node.

# Indegree(2) = 2 , Outdegree(2) = 2
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Path:
# 1. Path in an Undirected graph: A path is a sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeated.
# 2. Path is a Directed Graph: A path is a sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeated.
